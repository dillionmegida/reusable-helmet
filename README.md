# reusable-helmet-component

This is a resuable Helmet component template you can use to improve the SEO of your React applications. You can use this template in React frameworks like Gatsby and Next.js.

All you have to do is copy the template from this repo and paste in your component file, then make your desired modifications.

There are two variations of this template:

* [JS, with prop types](./helmet.js)
* [TS, with type definitions](./helmet.tsx)

Here's a video I made explaining how I created this reusable component and the elements in it: [How to create a reusable React Helmet component to improve the SEO of your app](https://youtu.be/cVTFHio6t-4)
